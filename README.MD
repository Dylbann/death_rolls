# Death Rolls (Foundry VTT Module)

A simple Foundry VTT module that adds **Death Rolls** to the chat.  
This mechanic starts with a large die (default `d100`) and keeps rolling smaller and smaller dice until someone rolls a **1**, ending the game.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Adds a `/deathrolls` chat command to start a Death Roll session.  
- Prompts the user for a starting die size (default `100`).  
- Posts a **Roll Death Roll** button in chat that *anyone* can click.  
- Rolls are always **public**, so all players see the results.  
- Old buttons automatically disable after being clicked.  
- Continues posting new buttons with the updated die size until a **1** is rolled.  
- Ends with a dramatic **💀 Game Over!** message when the 1 is rolled.
